    <h3>What is this website for?</h3>
    <p>Boy Scouts of America is moving towards a paperless camp registration process.  This website is designed to help you see camp availability, register for camps, and monitor your registration as you prepare for camp!</p>

That progress bar represents the camp availaility, for scouts only. Leaders, adults, and chiefs are not included in these numbers. The red color represents spots that are confirmed filled.  The yellow portion represents pending positions.  These are waiting for payment reciept before they turn red, and become confirmed.  Pending reservations will "timeout" if they remain unpaid for a week, and the spots will becoe available once again.  The green portion of the progress bar represents the outright availability of a camp!</p>
